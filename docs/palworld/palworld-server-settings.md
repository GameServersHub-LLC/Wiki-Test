# Palworld Server Settings: How to set up the Palworld configuration file.

## Locating the Configuration File

Before starting with the configuration process of your Palworld server, you need to locate a crucial file that stores all the default server settings. This file plays a significant role in governing several aspects of your server. To locate this file successfully, you can follow a few simple steps.

1\. To ensure that the \`**PalWorldSettings.ini**\` file is generated, running the \`**PalServer.exe**\` at least once is essential. Without running the \`**PalServer.exe**\`, the \`**PalWorldSettings.ini**\` file will not be created.

2\. To access the secure repository where the configuration files for your Palworld server are stored, you'll need to navigate to the designated directory path, which differs depending on your operating system. For **Linux** users, head to "**Saved/Config/LinuxServer/PalWorldSettings.ini**", while **Windows** users should go to "**Saved/Config/WindowsServer/PalWorldSettings.ini**". This repository is where you can manage and modify various settings that affect your Palworld server experience, so it's an important location to be familiar with.

## Understanding the Configuration File

Before you're in the editing process, please take a moment to get a chance to understand the intricate structure of the configuration file. Each setting manifests as a harmonious key-value pair within this digital blueprint, elegantly enclosed in square brackets. To illustrate, consider the following enlightening example:

` [/Script/Pal.PalGameWorldSettings]   ``OptionSettings=(Difficulty=None,DayTimeSpeedRate=1.000000) `

The assigned values to these keys wield power to intricately shape crucial server parameters, encompassing the nuances of difficulty levels, day and night speed rates, experience rates, and various other pivotal elements.

**`PlayerDamageRateAttack`:** This particular functionality aids in calculating the precise amount of damage that can be inflicted on other players and animals within the game.  
**`PlayerDamageRateDefense`:**Â This attribute calculates how much a player or animal can resist or withstand attacks or damage from external sources. It is an essential aspect of gameplay that allows players to survive in hostile environments and engage in combat with other players or creatures.  
**`DropItemMaxNum`**: This setting allows you to specify the highest possible amount of items that can be dropped within the game.

When it comes to the Palworld server, there are various settings that you can explore and customize to make your gameplay experience more enjoyable. Customization options include everything from adjusting the difficulty level to changing the weather and time of day. You can also fine-tune the rules of the game, like whether or not PvP combat is allowed or how frequently resources spawn. Experimenting with these settings to find what works best for you and your playing style is essential. Whether you prefer a more relaxed gaming experience or a challenging one, don't hesitate to make the adjustments to create a Palworld server that you'll love.

## Saving Changes and Restarting the Server

After you have made the required modifications to your Palworld server, it's very important to restart it to make sure the changes take effect. It's important to note that players may need to disconnect and reconnect to the server to experience the updated settings. This is because the server may not automatically apply the changes to the already connected players. Therefore, it's recommended that you let your players know beforehand about the server restart and advise them to reconnect after the restart to avoid any confusion or gameplay issues.
