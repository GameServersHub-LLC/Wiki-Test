# Frequently asked questions about (Game Servers)

## Why do I need to restart my game server?

- Fix bugs and glitches:
  - Regular restarts can fix some bugs and glitches that might happen during gameplay. Also lets the game update if there one is available.

- Prevent data loss:
  - Restarting can help prevent data loss by allowing the server to start fresh and delete any corrupted data.
  
- Flush RAM:
  - Restarting can flush the RAM and clear out temporary files and processes, which can help prevent "server cobwebs" from forming. This allows the server to run at peak performance.

**Prevent memory leaks over time, game servers can use up a lot of memory, which can slow down performance. Restarting daily can help prevent memory leaks and keep the server running smoothly.**

## Why should I shut my server down to edit the game files?

- Data Integrity:
  - When the server is running, it is actively reading and writing data. Editing game files while the server is operational can lead to data corruption or inconsistencies.

- Avoiding Conflicts:
  - Active processes might lock certain files or be using them, which can cause conflicts or errors if you try to modify those files at the same time.

- Preventing Crashes:
  - Making changes to game files while the server is running can cause unexpected behavior or crashes, potentially disrupting the experience for players currently online.

- Ensuring Changes Take Effect:
  - Many game servers load configuration and game files into memory when they start. By shutting down the server, you ensure that all changes are properly loaded and applied when you restart it.

- Security:
  - Editing files on a running server can expose vulnerabilities or create security risks. By shutting down the server, you minimize the window of opportunity for any potential security issues.

- Backup Opportunity:
  - Shutting down the server gives you a chance to back up the current state of the game files before making changes, providing a fallback option if something goes wrong.

**To ensure a smooth and error-free update process, it's best to always stop the server, make your edits, and then restart it.**
